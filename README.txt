As a Front-End Course project I develop a functional movie website wehere you can take information of upcoming and newest film as well as
old film. These procedure is realize by making diferents HTTP calls to several API's. 

It use Angular JS to bring out the costumer a dynamic experience and to prevent to load the full page in each click. With this framework, I 
was able to reduce the lenght of my code and to improve the efficiency of the website indeed. 

-----How is it works?-----

by default, the first time you visit the website you will find a list with the more popular movies of the date. Then you can browse through 
diferent options, like Upcoming Films to display incoming films in next months or you also can filter by name, year, and valoration
if you want to make a more exhaustive search. 

Of course, everytime you click into a movie, a modal will appear and bring you information about the film, such as title, duration, 
synopsis, trailer and related movies.
